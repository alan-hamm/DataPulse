# Dask Dashboard Local Setup Instructions

These instructions explain how to configure the Dask dashboard to restrict access to your local machine for security.

## 1. Binding the Dashboard to Localhost

To ensure the Dask dashboard is only accessible from your local machine, update your `distributed.yaml` file with the following settings. This setup prevents any external access by binding the dashboard to `localhost`.

Add the following in your `distributed.yaml` file:

dashboard:
  link: "http://localhost:8787/status"

This setting limits access to the machine on which Dask is running.

## 2. Configuring Allowed WebSocket Origins (Optional)

If you want to further restrict the dashboardâ€™s WebSocket origin, you can specify that only `localhost` is allowed:

dashboard:
  bokeh-application:
    allow_websocket_origin:
      - "localhost:8787"

### Important: Avoid Wildcards

Do **not** use a wildcard ("*") in `allow_websocket_origin`, as it would allow any machine to connect to your dashboard, which is less secure. Specifying only `localhost` ensures that only local applications have access.

## 3. Accessing the Dashboard

Once Dask is running, you can monitor your tasks by navigating to `http://localhost:8787/status` in your browser.

This configuration ensures that your Dask dashboard remains accessible only from your local machine, providing a secure setup for local-only use.
