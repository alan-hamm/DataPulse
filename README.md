# Scalable LDA Insights Framework (SLIF)
The Scalable LDA Insights Framework (SLIF) is a comprehensive Python package designed to facilitate the analysis and interpretation of large-scale datasets using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). Developed with pair programming techniques, SLIF offers robust tools for topic modeling, including functions to calculate symmetric and asymmetric alpha and beta parameters (calculate_numeric_alpha and calculate_numeric_beta), ensuring precision with the Decimal library. The package also provides utilities for data input/output operations (get_num_records, futures_create_lda_datasets), enabling efficient handling of JSON-formatted text data.

SLIF's train_model function is at the core of its modeling capabilities, allowing users to train LDA models with various configurations, manage corpus creation, dictionary generation, and compute coherence scores. It supports concurrency and batch processing for scalable performance. Additionally, SLIF includes functionality to save model artifacts (save_to_zip) and update metadata records (add_model_data_to_metadata) in Parquet format.

Visualization support is integrated into SLIF through the create_vis function, which leverages pyLDAvis for insightful topic distribution visualizations and Principal Coordinate Analysis (PCoA) for dimensionality reduction representations.

With logging built-in throughout the framework, users can expect detailed feedback on their modeling process, making debugging more straightforward. SLIF stands out as a versatile tool for researchers and practitioners looking to extract meaningful insights from textual data at scale.
